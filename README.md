# Test Laravel Api

Mr.amjed, in this brunch, I connected the amazing laravel framework with flutter app

first it need the php to start on real ip interface , not on loopback [localhost,127.0.0.1] (DevOps Move)

local Url = 'http://10.42.0.1:8000/api/'

storage Url = 'http://10.42.0.1:8000/storage/'

It's only for test proposes

and I hope you to have a good day ...

Dear Ala
