# Test Laravel Api

Mr.amjed, in this brunch, I connected the amazing laravel framework with flutter app

first it need the php to start on real ip interface , not on loopback [localhost,127.0.0.1] (DevOps Move)
****

## context

- api on wifi interface
  - local Url = 'http://10.42.0.1:8000/api/'
  - storage Url = 'http://10.42.0.1:8000/storage/'
- added files/folders
  - lib/api/*
- edited files
  - lib/Components/search_item.dart

****
It's only for test proposes

and I hope you to have a good day ...

Dear Ala
